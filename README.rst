Chroniker - Cron jobs controlled through Django
=============================================================================

Overview
--------

This is a fork of Weston Nielson's Chronograph_ project.

Control django-admin commands via the web.

Creating cron jobs for Django apps can be a pain, annoying and repetitive. With
django-chroniker you simply create a single cron job to run every minute,
point it at your site's directory and run manage.py cron. Then from the admin
you can add jobs.
